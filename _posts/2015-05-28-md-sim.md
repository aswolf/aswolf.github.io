The general behavior of materials under a range of conditions, including their bulk thermodynamic and dynamic properties, can be estimated computationally using molecular dynamics simulations.
This is a classical approach in which the trajectory of each atom is determined using Newton's equations of motion: `$ F_i = m_i \cdot a_i = \sum_j F_{ij}$` where the acceleration of the ith particle is determined as a sum over pairwise forces.

## Rigid Ion Potentials
Molecular dynamics simulations rely on 
<div>$$
  E_{ij}(r_{ij}) = \phi_{ij}(r_{ij}) + k_e \frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}
$$</div>

where the second term represents the Coulombic contribution to the potential energy and the first term gives the rest of the potential energy in terms of a pairwise interaction potential.
