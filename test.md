## Updated

The equilibrium affinity condition relative to the externally imposed chemical potential is:

$$
\phi_i \equiv \Delta \hat{\mu}_i - \mu^\mathrm{xs}_i = A + RTm\log X_i
$$

where $A$ is the saturation affinity of the phase relative to the imposed chemical potential, and $m$ is the site multiplicity such that $RTm \log X_i$ provides the ideal mixing entropy contribution to the Gibbs energy.
