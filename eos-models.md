##Vinet Equation of State
The "Universal" equation of state is derived from a direct representation of typical inter-atomic forces. It has been shown to have generally favorable extrapolation behavior to very high pressure. It provides a useful description of either an adiabatic or isothermal reference compression curve.
\$$ 
P(V)=  K_0\cdot 3(1-x)x^{-2} \exp[\eta (1-x)]
\$$
\$$ 
E(V)=  K_0 V_0\cdot (9/\eta^2) \\{ 1+ [\eta(1-x) -1]\exp[\eta (1-x)]\\}
\$$
where
\$$
x = (V/V_0)^{1/3}
\$$
\$$
\eta = 3/2 (K_0' - 1)
\$$
