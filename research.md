My research interests span a broad range of topics including planetary science, geochemistry, geophysics, and statistical analysis.
In particular, the bulk of my work is focused on understanding the chemistry and thermodynamics of the Earthâ€™s lower mantle.
I approach this topic with a variety of techniques, including diamond anvil cell experiments, thermodynamic modeling of first principles calculations, and simplified planetary evolution modeling.
I have also done work on determining the interior properties of extrasolar planets through their orbital evolution, as well as understanding near-shore bathymetry of lakes on Titan through careful statistical analysis of radar images.
You can see a list of my publications [here](publications.html).
Currently, I am working on three projects that I describe below in more detail.

###Open Projects found at [github.com/aswolf](http://github.com/aswolf)
In support of the goals of Open Science, to make research more accessible and reproducible (i.e. more scientific), I have begun posting many of my projects on my github site.

####I encourage you to take a look and think about what you can do to make your science more open!

##Simplified Modeling of Silicate Liquids at Mantle Conditions 
Determining the evolution of the Earth's mantle since formation is a crucial topic to understanding its present state.
This is particularly true given that temperature and composition are often highly degenerate in seismic observations of the mantle.
It has long been thought that the Earth likely went through one or more periods in which the mantle was predominantly or entirely molten.
This magma ocean scenario is a simple consequence of the extremely large energies involved in terrestrial planet accretion.
Recent experimental and theoretical work have shown that the properties of high pressure silicates are rather different from what was previously supposed, implying that crystallization of a magma ocean proceeds from the center outward rather than from the bottom up.
This shift in our understanding is a consequence of the depths of both crystallization and neutral crystal buoyancy.
Since these parameters are defined by composition-dependent equilibrium conditions, it is important to develop a simple model of silicate liquids that allows rapid determination of equations of state in a large chemically relevant system.
For this project, I have developed the Coordinated Hard Sphere Mixture (CHaSM), which can rapidly predict the behavior of complex silicate liquids over wide ranges in Temperature, Pressure, and Composition.
I am currently applying this general model to a simplified chemical representation of the Earth's mantle with an eye toward later using it to determine the chemical and thermal evolution of a planetary magma ocean.
(The first CHaSM paper is currently under review at GCA, see [publications](publications.html), and further work is underway to extend the model to a wider chemical system.)

##High P-T Diamond Anvil Cell Experiments
Iron-bearing magnesium silicate perovskite (recently named Bridgmanite) is thought to be the dominant mineral in the Earth's lower mantle, occupying ~80% by volume.
This makes it one of the most crucial phases to understanding the structure and long-term evolution of the Earth.
In this work, I set out to characterize the composition-dependent compression behavior of perovskite at realistic mantle conditions using laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments.
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the Advanced Photon Source, measuring the high temperature compression curves for (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite in a quasi-hydrostatic neon pressure medium for a range of iron compositions.
The resulting powder diffraction profiles are then fit to obtain perovskite volumes as a function of pressure and temperature.
From the extracted volumes, I construct high temperature equations of state for both Fe-bearing and Fe-free compositions, comparing with careful reanalysis of literature data.
Using Bayesian statistical techniques that are robust to outliers in the dataset, we are able to show that the thermal expansion trends with temperature for perovskite (even in the absence of iron) are considerably higher than previously thought.

##Unified Pressure Scales for Hi P-T Experiments
The structure and dynamics of the Earth's interior give us clues to how the Earth formed and how it has evolved over the last 4.5 billion years.
In order to interpret seismic observations, we rely on high pressure and temperature (high P-T) experiments to determine the behavior of rocky materials at the extreme conditions deep within the Earth.
Unfortunately, we cannot directly measure the pressures in these experiments, but must instead rely on the calibrated behavior of pressure markers such as ruby, gold, platinum, or MgO.
We are therefore highly dependent on a limited set of pressure markers and extremely sensitive to uncertainties in their high P-T properties.
To address the systematic errors in these calibrated pressure scales, we are developing a new unified pressure scale using a Bayesian analysis of published high P-T measurements called the UnBIASeD (**Un**ified **B**ayesian **I**terative **A**nd **S**yst**e**matically **D**etermined) Pressure scale.
As this is an entirely open project, meant to provide both models and easy access to literature data, it is posted on my github page at [github.com/aswolf/unbiased-pscale](https://github.com/aswolf/unbiased-pscale).
I am working on this project with two Univ. of Michigan undergraduates, Rong Zhou and Wardah Mohammad Fadil, through the [UROP](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/urop/) undergraduate research program.


##Modeling Atomic Ordering in Fe-bearing Perovskite from 1st Principles Calculations
High quality experimental data is ideally the best standard for determining the thermodynamic properties of earth materials, however it is often difficult and costly to perform experiments at the relevant extreme conditions.
Furthermore, experiments provide a relatively sparse sampling of Pressure-Temperature-Composition space, and so theoretical calculations will always be useful in constructing a detailed overall picture of the thermodynamics of complex systems.
In this work with Paul Asimow and Razvan Caracas, we use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the energies and volumes of iron-bearing silicate perovskite at mantle pressures.
I construct a full thermodynamic model of perovskite at mantle conditions by combining static DFT data together with perturbation calculations that explore the vibrational behavior of the crystal structures.
In particular, we are interested in characterizing the spin state of iron in mantle perovskites, which can have a large observable effect on material properties, and in determining the location and form of the spin transition in perovskites at high temperature.
Eventually, we aim to combine this model with a similar model for ferropericlase, the other major phase in the lower mantle, to obtain a complete thermodynamic model for a simplified lower mantle system.
