##Mineral-Rock-Melts Reading Group

###EARTH 535--section 060 (*Fall 2014*)
MRM is a weekly reading group for faculty, postdocs, and students interested in the behavior of rocks, minerals, and melts throughout the Earth (and other planets).
This provides an informal setting where we discuss papers from a broad range of topics including mineral physics, petology, and geochemistry, in addition to occasional works from adjacent fields such as geophysics and planetary science.

##Practical Bayesian Data Analysis
I co-taught/assisted teaching this course at Caltech in 2013. I have plans to further develop it and teach it again in the future.
